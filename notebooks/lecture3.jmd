## Simulating the limits to growth 

In 1968 a small international group of people from the fields of academia, civil society, diplomacy, and industry gathered in [Villa Farnesina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Farnesina) in Rome for a meeting organized by the famous industrialist [Aurelio Peccei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelio_Peccei).
Peccei held that viewing problems of humankind—environmental deterioration, poverty, endemic ill-health, urban blight, criminality—individually, in isolation or as "problems capable of being solved in their own terms", was doomed to failure, since they're all profoundly **interrelated**.

He and the then Director-General for Scientific Affairs at the [OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD), [Alexander King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_King_(scientist)), went on to found the
[Club of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_of_Rome), with the mission to investigate such pressing global issues.

### The Limits to Growth

In 1972 [Donella H. Meadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donella_Meadows), [Dennis L. Meadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Meadows), [Jørgen Randers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B8rgen_Randers) and William W. Behrens III, representing a team of 17 researchers, published a report on the exponential economic and population growth with a finite supply of resources, titled [The Limits to Growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth).
Several other reports followed in the subsequent decades (see the references at the end of these notes).

The study was based on a computer simulations on the 
interactions between the earth and human systems, 
developed by [Jay Forrester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester) at MIT. 
The model was called 
[World3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3). 

## World3

World3 was developed in 1972. That's the same year the [C language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) first appeared. 
Indeed, the language used for World3 is a now-dead language [DYNAMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DYNAMO_(programming_language)), created under Forrester's direction.

Essentially, World3 consist of a  discrete-time dynamical system that can be regarded as the [Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) discretization of a continuous-time system. 
The book with the source code is [accessible on archive.org](https://archive.org/details/dynamicsofgrowth0000unse).
Here is a diagram of the whole system, were nodes represent variables and edges represent some dependency between the two variables:

Bearing in mind that this simulation was conducted in the 60s, when the C language didn't even exist and computational resources were extremely limited, 
we notice that the Euler method, which is the simplest method to discretize a differential equation, has several shortcomings, and the performed simulation considered a time-step of **5 years**. 

Subsequent works re-implemented it using simulation-oriented programming languages such as [STELLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STELLA_(programming_language)) and [Modelica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelica). 
Research has also been conducted to investigate the system's [sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis), among other aspects (see e.g. [Thissen]).
