The purpose of this note is to present a simple model of infections disease dynamics, by using ordinary differential equations. 

We will focus primarily on studying the following aspects:
- the impact of suppression through social distancing on the spread of the infection,
- the number of infections at a given time (which determines whether or not the health care system is overwhelmed), and  
- how long the caseload can be deferred (hopefully, until a vaccine is being deployed). 

## The SEIR model

We are going to investigate the [Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model)
